# 5. Introduction

## 5.1 Background and Rationale for the Study

Neurovexorin, a centrally acting neuromodulator, has been increasingly utilized in the management of various neuromuscular diseases, including myasthenia gravis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and certain forms of muscular dystrophy. The pharmacological profile of Neurovexorin suggests a mechanism through which it modulates neuromuscular transmission and alleviates symptoms associated with these debilitating conditions.

Despite the therapeutic advantages afforded by Neurovexorin, concerns surrounding long-term usage necessitate comprehensive investigation. Preliminary reports and existing literature highlight potential safety issues, including but not limited to hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, and neuropsychiatric adverse events. Consequently, this study aims to conduct an extensive examination of these safety concerns, particularly in a post-marketing context, where long-term follow-up and monitoring are essential for verifying the drug’s safety profile in diverse populations.

## 5.2 Current Knowledge on the Drug

Neurovexorin operates primarily through selective inhibition of specific neurotransmitters involved in neuromuscular synaptic transmission. Research indicates that Neurovexorin enhances synaptic efficacy and promotes muscle contraction, making it a compelling option for the management of neuromuscular diseases.

Several studies have documented its efficacy in reducing muscle weakness and improving functional outcomes in patients with myasthenia gravis and other similar disorders. Neurovexorin has shown promise in clinical settings, with significant improvements observed in metrics such as the Modified Osserman Scale (MOS) and the Myasthenia Gravis Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL) scales.

However, despite these documented benefits, there exists a substantial knowledge gap regarding the cumulative effects of long-term Neurovexorin administration. Current data largely stem from short- to mid-term studies, which highlight the necessity for ongoing evaluation and surveillance to better understand both the therapeutic impact and the long-term safety profile of the drug.

# 14. Statistical Considerations

## 14.1 Sample Size Calculation

The sample size for this clinical trial has been determined based on the objective of ensuring adequate power to detect a statistically significant difference in the primary efficacy endpoint between the treatment group and the control group. The rationale for enrolling 500 patients (250 per treatment arm) is elaborated as follows:

1. **Expected Effect Size**: Assuming an expected difference in the primary endpoint of X% and a significance level (alpha) set at 0.05, with a power of 80%, we conducted the sample size calculation using the formula for evaluating proportions. This yields the need for a total of 500 patients to detect a clinically meaningful difference.

2. **Statistical Methodology**: The sample size was calculated using [specify software or methodology], assuming a two-sided test. The calculations focused on the binomial distribution prevalent in the assessment of efficacy outcomes and applied continuity correction where applicable.

3. **Drop-out Rate**: An anticipated drop-out rate of 20% was accounted for, ensuring that even with incomplete data, the integrity of statistical power would be maintained. To adjust for this potential drop-out, we calculated a need for an additional 100 patients, culminating in a total enrollment target of 500 patients.

4. **Subgroup Analyses**: The sample size is also sufficient to conduct planned subgroup analyses (e.g., by age, gender, and comorbidities), allowing for exploration of treatment effects across various demographics while maintaining adequate power.

### Table 1: Sample Size Calculation Summary
